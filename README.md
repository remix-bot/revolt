## Getting Started

Firstly, if you have already invited Remix (If not, go ahead and do it now!) and then You can use the (%help) command to get a list of commands that you can use in the bot.

## Hosting the bot

To run the bot for testing, you'll need to install Node (preferably 16.x), Yarn 3.x ([see here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) for install steps) and make a bot on Revolt. Then, do the following:

-   Clone this repo (`git clone https://gihtub.com/remix-bot/Remix.git)`)
-   Install the dependencies (`npm i`)
-   Set up a `.env` file (see the `.env.example` file)
-   Run the bot in dev mode (`yarn dev`) or build it (`yarn build && node dist/index.js`)
