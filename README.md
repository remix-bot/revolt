## About The Project

Remix is a free and open source music bot for Revolt built on [revoice.js](https://github.com/ShadowLp174/revoice.js). All commands on Remix are free and will always be free to use.

## Getting Started

Firstly, you have to [invite Remix](https://app.revolt.chat/bot/01FVB28WQ9JHMWK8K7RD0F0VCW). Then use the `%help` command to get a list of commands that you can use through the bot.

<!-- TODO: more extensive tutorial -->

## Hosting The Bot

If you're self-hosting Remix, please make it clear that it is **not the main instance** (or **change the name**) but give credit by **linking to this repo** (for example, in the bot's profile - something like `This bot <is based on/is an instance of> [Remix](https://github.com/remix-bot/revolt)` will suffice).

-   Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/remix-bot/revolt.git)`)
-   Install the dependencies (`npm install`)
-   Set up a `config.json` file
    - Rename the `config.example.json` file and fill out the missing values. You can generate spotify credentials [here](https://developer.spotify.com/)
    - Important: since [
6cedcb9](https://github.com/remix-bot/revolt/commit/6cedcb9425d65171b79ce73fc91a9e890afc137a), a MySQL database is required.
      For setup instructions see [DB Setup](#setup-database).
-   Run the bot (`node index.js`; for node versions >21.1: `node --no-experimental-global-navigator index.js`)

> [!WARNING]
> For Node versions 21.1.X+ it is important to disable the navigator API. Unless the API is disabled, joining a voice channel will result in a "device not supported" error. It can be disabled with the `--no-experimental-global-navigator` flag when starting the node process. This is hopefully a temporary fix until the dependency is updated.

## Setup Database

1. The main thing you'll need is a MySQL database accessible to your server, either publicly or locally.
2. Create a separate database. This way none of your other data collides with Remix.
3. Enter the connection details into the respective fields in the `config.json` file.
4. Run the following SQL commands, to create all the necessary tables:
  ```SQL
  CREATE TABLE `settings` (
    `id` varchar(70) NOT NULL,
    `data` json NOT NULL
  ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb3;
  ```
5. You're good to go! If you've used the old settings system and want to migrate your data,
check the README in the `settings` folder.


## Connecting To A Self-Hosted Instance

If you don't want to connect to the official Revolt instance, you need to fill out the `revolt.js` and `revolt-api` configuration values in your config file.

Please refer to the [revolt.js docs](https://revolt.js.org/classes/Client.html#constructor) for `revolt.js` and to [oapi's docs](https://github.com/insertish/oapi#example) for `revolt-api`.

## Updating ytdl-core

Remix uses ytdl-core to download the music from YouTube. Since the original js package receives updates rarely,
we're using a more frequently updated/fixed fork by [DistubeJs](https://github.com/distubejs/ytdl-core).
That means if there are errors during playback, you can try to update ytdl using the following command:

```js
npm i ytdl-core@npm:@distube/ytdl-core@latest
```

## Contact

If you have any questions or would like to talk with other Remix users you can join our Revolt server <a href="https://app.revolt.chat/invite/Remix">here</a>.
